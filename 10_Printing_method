In Java printing is done with the help of System.out.println();

Java is providing a builtin class called System and this have a builin object call out.
out object belongs to the print stream class.
out object is attached with the monitor.out is a static object so we use it by using dot operator.

There are four types of methods available in java:-
  1)System.out.print();
  2)System.out.println();
  3)System.out.printf();
  4)System.out,format();

Overloaded Methods:- Those methods whhich have different  parameter with same class name are called overloaded methods.
print stream method will take more than one parameter such as int float char as well as String. so it is overloaded method.


Example:-
package printing;

import java.util.*;

public class Printing {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        /*int a=10;
        float b=12.55f;
        char c='A';
        String str="Hello";
        
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(str);*/
        
        
        int x=10,y=20;
        System.out.println(x+y);
        System.out.println("Number is " +y);
        System.out.println(x+y+" sum");
        System.out.println("sum "+(x+y));
        System.out.println("sum of "+x+" and "+y+" is "+(x+y));
    }
    
}


///
  int x=10 ,y=20;
  System.out.println(x+y+" Sum");

  o/p:- 30 Sum
///

///
    int x=10 ,y=20;
    System.out.println("Sum "+x+y);
   o/p:- SUm 1020

   It is taking + as concatenation.
///
