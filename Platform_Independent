Platform Independent 

• Java is platform independent language.
• Java compiler will convert source code into byte code although
this byte code is not executable but it is a error free program.
• To execute this java program we call a JVM ( java virtual
machine ) and ask them to execute this file.
• This virtual machine will have an interpreter or JIT(Just in time) Compiler that
will convert this byte code into machine code and get it executed
on the hardware.
• JVM cannot directly interact with the hardware , it needs to
interact via a software.

          
First.java   ---->   First.class ----> JVM <----> Operating System---Hardware
            compile               java
             javac

First.cpp  ------> First.cece -----> Opearing Ssytem----Hardware
           compile             run
How java is platform independent ?

• All the bytes codes first interact with JVM , as it is the source
which converts the source code into the machine code of java .
• As the byte code is same it can run on various operation system
and produce the same result provided that it has a JVM hence
Java is platform independent.
• Therefore once you compile a java code you can run it anywhere.
