System.out.println();

Java provides built in class called System and this class have a static built in object called out and this object is belongs to the some class called print Stream.

The out object is attached to a monitor.
As out is statc mobject it is use by dot operator.and this object is having various method inside print stream class.There are methods called print(),println(),printf(),format().

overloaded methods?
Means methods with the same name but different in parameter list, or the parameters are different.

there are four methods available for printing:
1) System.out.print();
2) System.out.println();
3) System.out.printf();
4) System.out.format();

example)
public class Print {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int x=10,y=20;
        float f=10.2f;
        double db=457.98D;
        boolean b=true;
        String str="Printing Method";     

        System.out.print(x); //Printing in one line
        System.out.println(y); //printing in more line and started with new line
        System.out.printf("ans:%f\n",f); //printf is used as use in C
        System.out.printf("ans:%e\n",db);// Format specifier of double is same as float,
        System.out.printf("ans:%f\n",db);// but if in scientific representation %e is used.
        System.out.format("ans:%b\n",b);// Format specifier of boolean is %b.
        System.out.print(b);
        System.out.printf("\n%s",str);//Format specifier of boolean is %b
        System.out.printf(str);//also we can use this type.

        System.out.println(x+y+"Sum");//+ is use for concatenation of string.Operation are done from left to right
        System.out.println("Sum"+x+y);//So the output will be different first output is 30Sum and second is Sum1020.
    }
}

Use brackets to make higher precedence of particular operator.
