What is variables ?
  Variable are the Container which contains the data of any Data type.
  Variables are first declare and then initialize in java/c/c++.
  In python,it is not allowed to first declare and then initialize.
  python automatically fetch the data and make suitable variable of data type.

  Ex)  In Java/C/C++                                           In python
      int a;  //Declaration of variable                   a=6;    # Declaration and Initialization both
      a=5;   //Initialization of variable
 So In conclusion, the variables are use to store some data types.

What is Data type?
Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable.
