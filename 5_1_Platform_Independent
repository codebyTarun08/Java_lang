Platform Independent 

• Java is platform independent language.
• Java compiler will convert source code into byte code although
this byte code is not executable but it is a error free program.
• To execute this java program we call a JVM ( java virtual
machine ) and ask them to execute this file.
• This virtual machine will have an interpreter or JIT(Just in time) Compiler that
will convert this byte code into machine code and get it executed
on the hardware.
• JVM cannot directly interact with the hardware , it needs to
interact via a software.

          
First.java   ---->   First.class ----> JVM <----> Operating System---Hardware
            compile               java
             javac

First.cpp  ------> First.cece -----> Opearing Ssytem----Hardware
           compile             run

c/c++ is a platform dependent language becaude their exe file is depenent upon system calls of that operating system like windows and macOS.
So, C/C++ windows exe program cannot run on any other OS like macOS.

System Calls are that calls when program wants some work done on hardware but it will not directly interact with hardware it uses OS for workdone and that can be call by System Calls.

How java is platform independent ?

• All the bytes codes first interact with JVM , as it is the source
which converts the source code into the machine code of java .
• As the byte code is same it can run on various operation system
and produce the same result provided that it has a JVM hence
Java is platform independent.
• Therefore once you compile a java code you can run it anywhere.



                                First.java
                                    |
                                First.class
                     _______________|______________
                   |                |               |
                JVM               JVM              JVM
                 |                 |                |
              Windows           Linux              macOS   

Java is a platform independent language as it has byte code (Not executable program but error free program) and thisbyte code will execute by JVM on any OS the output will be same.
