Increment/Decrement Operator:- this operator is used to increment/decrement the value of Integer,floatand character type by 1.
Note:-It is applicable on int,byte,char but not on boolean.
Types:- i)Post Increment/Decrement
        2)pre  Inccremnt/Decrement
Syntax:i)Post Increment/Decrement x++; :- In post increment it use the value after that it increment the value by one.
       2)pre  Inccremnt/Decrement --x; :- In pre increment it first increment the value after that it use the value.

Example:- 1) int x=5;
             x++;
             ++x;
          2) int x=5,y;
             y=x++;
      //First Assignment is done means y is 5 after x is increment means after x is 6.
          3)int x=5,y;
            y=++x;
      //First increment operator is done means y is 6 and x is also 6.
          4)float x=5.3;
            x++;
          o/p=6.3
          5)byte x=4;
            x++;
          6)char x='A';     //'A' is 65
            x++;
           System.out.print(x);
          o/p= 66 means 'B'
          7)int x=5,y=4,z;
            z=2*x++ + 3* ++y;
            System.out.println(z);
           o/p=10+15=>z=25
