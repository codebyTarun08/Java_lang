Increment/Decrement Operator:- this operator is used to increment/decrement the value of Integer,floatand character type by 1 unit.
Note:-It is applicable on int,byte,char but not on boolean.
Types:- i)Post Increment/Decrement
        2)pre  Inccremnt/Decrement
Syntax:i)Post Increment/Decrement x++; :- In post increment it use the value after that it increment the value by one.
       2)pre  Inccremnt/Decrement --x; :- In pre increment it first increment the value after that it use the value.

Example:- 1) int x=5;
             x++;
             ++x;
          2) int x=5,y;
             y=x++;
      //First Assignment is done means y is 5 after x is increment means after x is 6.
          3)int x=5,y;
            y=++x;
      //First increment operator is done means y is 6 and x is also 6.
          4)float x=5.3;
            x++;
          o/p=6.3
          5)byte x=4;
            x++;
          6)char x='A';     //'A' is 65
            x++;
           System.out.print(x);
          o/p= 66 means 'B'
          7)int x=5,y=4,z;
            z=2*x++ + 3* ++y;
            System.out.println(z);
           o/p=10+15=>z=25

Note:- byte b;
       b=b+1;
o/p= It is throw error because integer(1) is added with byte results in integer and it assigns it in byte so it throw error.
     as we cannot assign big to small.

So the Solution is b=b++;
It will never throw error.
