What are Methods?
Methods are the members of Classes which provide functionality to the Classes.

At Beginning,all programs are written in a monolithic style and it creates a problem when a error occurs.So,
  the solution is modular programming in which a program is devided into main function and other 
  modules for example: module 1 ,module 2, module 3, module 4...

  but in oops based programming there are changes in 
  program is called Class
  main is called data
  modules is called Methods.
So the conclusion is Methods are like the function in C/C++.

Syntax:- 
          Signature
             |
          returnType methodName(parameter List)
          {
            ----        // body of method
            ----      
          }
Example:

class Test
{
      static int max(int x,int y)
      {
        if(x>y)
           return x;
        else
           return y;
      }
      public static void main(String[] args){
      int a=10,b=5,c;
      c= max(a,b);             //10
      System.out.println(c);
      }
}
Note:-   The method should be static otherwise it will not called.
O/P :-
    method max is called and the returned value is assigned to c variable.
