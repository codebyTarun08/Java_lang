import java.lang.*;
class MyFirst
{
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
    System.out.println("Welcome to java learning Repository");
   }
}

Here import .java.lang.*; line importing the java language library into our program. and If we do not write it , it will be automatically included in oor program on compile time.

class First is uses for creating a Class. if we add public in beginning of line then it class name and file name is should be same otherwise it thrown an error.

public static void main(String args[]) line demonstrate that the  public is globallly scoped in code block and static is help jvm to identify the main method.
void means it does not returning anything ,
main(Whatever) is describes that it is a method exactly same as a function in other languages lin c,c++.
String shows it is Class because its first letter is Capital

System.out.println("Hllo"); shows that the System is s Classes and out is object and
println is method use for printing multiple lines and prin("") Method is use for printing one line.
