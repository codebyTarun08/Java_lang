String is an built in class in Java.it is use as data type.

String is a collection of characters that are forming words or sentences.

Syntax:    String str="Java Program";

       String is a class.
       str is a referemce to the literal.
       "Java Program" is a String object or literal.

       String is stored in the memory as an array and string character can be access by the index.


       str1----->J a v a   p r o g r a m 
       |__|      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11


Constructors are methods or functions that are used for creating objects.
here for creating strings these constructors are use 1) .String(char[])
                                                     2) .String(byte[])
                                                     3) .String(string)

1) char c[]={'A','B','C','D'};
String str1=new String(c);

     str1---->ABCD
              0123

2) byte b[]={65,66,67,68};
  String str2=new String(b);

  str1---->ABCD
           0123

3) String str1=new String("Java");

 Here a constant literal is passing and it is also create in heap memory by using new keyword.
 So, here two objects are created 
 1) constant literal is created in pool.
 2)By using new keyword,object is created in heap memory and str1 will be the reference to that object.

  In heap                                       In pool
 str1----->|Java|                                   Java

 => Both object will occupy space in memory one in heap and other one in poolo.

  (ii) String str2="java Program";

   str2----->|Java Program|
   this literal will occupy space in pool.


More on Strings:-

  String str1="java"; //means str1 is pointing to the java object and this object is created in pool.
  String str2="java"; //Now it is check whether the object is created in pool or not it it exists then it will not created and reference will be made to it.

      str1-------->java
                  ^
                  |
                 str2

   String str3=new String("java");//Now a new string object is created in heap memory and literal object will be checked in pool it exists or not.


   => whenever 3rd constructor method is use to create it is not neccesary two objects are created it may be equal to two or less than two.
   
   Example) WAP to create a String and check two reference are pointing to one object or not.
   Program:-
   public class StringCreation {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
         String str1="Java Program";
         System.out.println(str1);
         String str2=new String("java");
         System.out.println(str2);

         char c[]={'H','E','L','L','O'};
         String str3=new String(c);
         System.out.println(str3);

         byte b[]={64,65,66,67,68};
         String str4=new String(b);
         System.out.println(str4);

         /**Slicing of strings
         To check strings methods write the command in cmd  javap java.lang.String  */

         String str5=new String(c,1,3);
         System.out.println(str5);
         String str6=new String(b,2,2);
         System.out.println(str6);

         /* To check the two or more references are pointing to one object or not */
         String str7="Same object";
         String str8="Same object";
         System.out.println(str7==str8);//Gives boolean value
         //str is the reference so it hold the address of object and comparison of addresses are done.
         String str9="same object";
         System.out.println(str7==str9);//Java is case sensitive
       }
}
