OPERATOR AND EXPRESSIONS

Arithmetic operator and expressions:
➢ +,	-,	*,	/,	%.	
➢ These	operators	can	be	applied	on	any	type	of	data	except	Boolean.	
➢ %	operator	works	on	>loat	and	double	data	types	without	taking	the	
decimal	point	in	quotient	but	the	divisor	and	dividend	contain	the	
decimal	point.	
➢ To	write	down	the	expression	one	should	be	familiar	with	the	
precedence	of	operators.	
➢ *,	/,	%	have	higher	precedence	than	+,	-.	
➢ To	change	the	precedence	of	operators	()	are	used.	
➢ The	mechanism	of	converting	data	type	internally	by	the	compiler	is	
known	as	“COERCION”.	
➢ Data	types	of	expression:	
              • The	addition,	subtraction,	multiplication	or	division	
                between	the	byte,	short	and	int	results	as	int	as	they	belong	
                integer	type	of	data.	
              • Byte	and	short	are	provided	by	java	for	backward	
                compatibility.	
              • If	>loat	is	used	in	the	expression	then	the	result	is	>loat.	
              • If	Double	is	used	in	the	expression	then	the	result	is	double.	
              • When	char	is	used	the	result	is	int	type	as	char	is	part	of	
                int(codes).
